'''
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal =1+5+9=15 . The right to left diagonal =3+5+9=17 . Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2.

Function description
Complete the diagonalDifference  function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr .
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j] .

Constraints
-100<=arr[i][j]<=100

Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15
Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
   5
     -12
Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

     4
   5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Note: |x| is the absolute value of x
